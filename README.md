## Description 

## Get Access to Genesis What's New Admin Page
This simple & lightweight plugin has currently only one task: bring you access to the "What's New" page for Genesis Framework. You can access it everytime in the left-hand admin menu under "Genesis > What's New". (Before this plugin it did only show up when you did an auto update of Genesis.)

**Please note:** The plugin requires the *Genesis Theme Framework*, a paid premium product released by StudioPress/ WPEngine, Inc. (via studiopress.com).

## Installation 

**NOTE:** Only works with *Genesis Framework* as the parent theme. This is a paid premium product by StudioPress/ WPEngine, Inc., available via studiopress.com.


### Installation of Plugin: 
1. Installing alternatives:
 * *via Admin Dashboard:* Go to **Plugins > Add New**, search for "Genesis What's New Info", click "install"
 * *OR via direct ZIP upload:* Upload the ZIP package via **Plugins > Add New > Upload** in your WP Admin
 * *OR via FTP upload:* Upload `genesis-whats-new-info` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the "Genesis" admin page and you'll see a new sub menu item "What's New" - which shows you the recent updates for your installed version branch of Genesis Framework.

**Note:** The "Genesis Framework" is required for this plugin in order to work. If you don't own a copy it yet, this premium parent theme has to be bought. More info about that you'll find here: https://ddwb.me/getgenesis


## Frequently Asked Questions 


### Where does the content come from? 
The content of the "What's New" page comes straight from Genesis core! This plugin only hooks in a few links to this *already existing* admin page.



### Why a new meta box on Genesis Settings? 
The existing "Information" meta box from Genesis core has not much useful info. The new "At a Glance" box brings more info and links, also for the active child theme.



### More info on Translations? 

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/genesis-whats-new-info/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `genesis-whats-new-info-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

**Easy WordPress.org plugin translation platform with GlotPress platform:** [**Translate "Genesis What's New Info"...**](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/genesis-whats-new-info)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.
