Easy access of the Genesis What's New Admin overview page - not only on updates but everytime. Makes sense, heh? :)

== Description ==

> #### Get Access to Genesis What's New Admin Page
> This simple & lightweight plugin has currently only one task: bring you access to the "What's New" page for Genesis Framework. You can access it everytime in the left-hand admin menu under "Genesis > What's New". (Before this plugin it did only show up when you did an auto update of Genesis.)

**Please note:** The plugin requires the *Genesis Theme Framework*, a paid premium product released by StudioPress/ Copyblogger Media LLC (via studiopress.com).

**NOTE:** Only works with *Genesis Framework* as the parent theme. This is a paid premium product by StudioPress/ Copyblogger Media LLC, available via studiopress.com.

= Installation of Plugin: =
1. Installing alternatives:
 * *via Admin Dashboard:* Go to 'Plugins > Add New', search for "Genesis What's New Info", click "install"
 * *OR via direct ZIP upload:* Upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
 * *OR via FTP upload:* Upload `genesis-whats-new-info` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/genesis-whats-new-info/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `genesis-whats-new-info-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where does the content come from? =

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, Mac and Linux.

== Idea Behind / Philosophy ==
Really simple stuff: bring a link to an already existing Genesis admin page to the left-hand admin menu. Result: "Genesis > What's New"
